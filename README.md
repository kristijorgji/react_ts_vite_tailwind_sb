## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with a modern toolchain for speed, scalability, and developer experience:

- ⚡ [Vite](https://vite.dev/) — lightning-fast build tool
- 💅 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — utility-first styling & CSS framework
- 🧹 Eslint — code linting
- 🎨 Prettier — code formatting
- 🧪 [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + @testing-library/react — unit testing
- 🧩 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — component development and testing environment
- 🌐 [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) — Internationalization framework used for managing translations

# 🛠️ Getting Started

## 1. Install Dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the provided template:

```shell
cp .env.dist .env
```

Then, edit `.env` and fill in the correct values.

> ⚠️ **Note:** All frontend-accessible environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.  
> You can access them via `import.meta.env`, for example:

```ts
const apiBasePath = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_PATH;
```

The variables that are intended to be used into the frontend code must start with
`VITE_` and can be used like for example `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_PATH`

## 3. Start The Web

Development mode

```shell
yarn dev
```

Build for production

```shell
yarn build
```

You can preview locally

```shell
yarn preview
```

---

# 🧑‍💻Local development

You can use either

```shell
yarn dev
```

to start with hot module reload the page locally.

Or you can work with the components library by using `storybook`

```shell
yarn storybook
```

# ✅ Testing

The frontend components are tested using:

- **Unit tests** – to verify component logic and behavior.
- **Snapshot tests** – to ensure the rendered output remains consistent over time.

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) together
with [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for a fast and modern
testing workflow.

To run tests and update snapshots

```shell
yarn test -u
```

# 🌐Translations

This project leverages [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for full i18n support.

- Translation files are located in: `public/locales`
- Main config: [`i18n.ts`](src/i18n/i18n.ts)
- Supported and default locales: [`locales.ts`](src/i18n/locales.ts)
- Extra default configuration is located at [config.ts](src/core/config.ts) key `localization` in order to specify
  if you want to use locales in the path parameters and whether to use prefix for the default locale

To generate TypeScript type definitions for the locale files, run:

```shell
yarn gen:i18n
```

This enables full type safety and better developer experience when working with translations.

# 🧭 Navigation

This project uses localization combined with custom routing logic to handle multi-language paths seamlessly.

### Guidelines

- Define your routes inside [routes.ts](src/core/routing/routes.ts)
- Define route-to-component mapping in [routesConfig.tsx](src/core/routing/routesConfig.tsx)
- Define routes for the non-default locales only for the paths you want to override.
- Example:

```ts
export const ROUTES: LocalizedRouteMap = {
    [LOCALES.ENGLISH]: {
        [ROUTES_IDS.INDEX]: {href: "/"},
        [ROUTES_IDS.LOGIN]: {href: "/login"},
        [ROUTES_IDS.SETTINGS]: {href: "/settings"},
    },
    [LOCALES.GERMAN]: {
        [ROUTES_IDS.LOGIN]: {href: "/anmelden"},
    },
} as const;
```

If we have locale `de` and try to open `/settings` the page will open in locale `de` although there is no route
specified for de,
it will fallback to the default locale `en` route.

Unspecified locale routes fall back to default locale (`en`) automatically.

### Routing Best Practices

- Define route-to-component mapping in [routesConfig.tsx](src/core/routing/routesConfig.tsx)
- Use custom routing utilities from `@/core/routing` — avoid `react-router-dom` directly
- Use [createLocalizedRoute.tsx](src/core/routing/createLocalizedRoute.tsx) instead of `Route`
- Use `localizeRoutePath` from [localizedRoute.ts](src/core/routing/localizedRoute.ts) to generate locale-aware paths
- Use [NavLink.tsx](src/core/routing/NavLink.tsx) to generate locale-aware Links
- Navigate via `navigate` from [useNavigate.ts](src/core/routing/useNavigate.ts)
- Get the current matched route [useMatchedRoute.ts](src/core/routing/useMatchedRoute.ts)
- Always reference routes via `ROUTE_IDS` for consistency and safety across locales
